I am taking a Python course through udemy.com. The instructor is Dr. Angela Yu. During this course there are many 'coding challenges' and other projects. The course name is: 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023. 

I have decided to break up the many challenges and projects by going through 10 days of the course, then revisiting every challenge. I believe this will strengthen my coding knowledge that I am aquiring in this course. My goal is to not look at the code that I have already done for the challenge and complete the running program again of my own volition.

I will have of course my code in these challenges and projects, as well as the instructions that I was given originally to complete them.

These README's will be cut and paste. The only changes I will make for each repository are (1) The section of days in the course where this program falls and (2) Whether or not I had to look at my final solution to finish this program.

As of this moment, the GitHub licenses are a little confusing. I'm sure I will pick up on them relatively quickly. All I can say for sure is that I do not have express consent to call these challenges my own; they are part of the course that I am taking.

This challenge is in between days: 1 - 10

I did not have to look at the solution to complete this challenge.
(I am not writing that line for anyone but myself when I look back on these challenges as I grow with my coding career)
